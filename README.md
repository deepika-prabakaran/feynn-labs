# Market segmentation
Market segmentation is a decision-making tool for the marketing manager in the
crucial task of selecting a target market for a given product and designing an appropriate marketing mix . Market segmentation is one
of the key building blocks of strategic marketing. Market segmentation is essential for marketing success: the most successful firms drive their businesses based on
segmentation . Market segmentation lies at the heart of successful marketing (McDonald 2010), tools such as segmentation have the largest impact on marketing decisions was the first to propose the use of segmentation as a marketing strategy. Smith defines market segmentation as viewing a heterogeneous market
(one characterised by divergent demand) as a number of smaller homogeneous markets. Conceptually, market segmentation sits between the two extreme
views that  all objects are unique and inviolable and the population is homogeneous . One of the simplest and clearest definitions
is that used in a newsletter by Grey Advertising Inc. and cited in Haley market segmentation means cutting markets into slices. Ideally, consumers
belonging to the same market segments â€“ or sets of buyers are very similar to one another with respect to the consumer characteristics
deemed critical by management. At the same time, optimally, consumers belonging to different market segments are very different from one another with respect to
those consumer characteristics. Consumer characteristics deemed critical to market segmentation by management are referred to as segmentation criteria
